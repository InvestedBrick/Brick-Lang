for structs:
    seperate a struct info vector and a struct vector  
    store struct info ( not generated vars ) in struct info vector
    when generating struct get from struct info vector and generate variables
    scrape variables from top of var vectors
    put them in the struct vector struct when accessing struct variables search in the struct vector with namespace
