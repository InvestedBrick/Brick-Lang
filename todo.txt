Needs to be refactored
    
checklist:
[X] Functions and return values
[X] support negative numbers
[X] Arrays (add as function argument --> doable with startptr and length)
[X] pointers
[X] importing other files 
[X] logical operators for control statements
[X] make double operations expressions
[X] structs
[ ] make array indexing from startptr possible like in C
[ ] change stringbuffers??
[ ] floating points
[ ] dynamic memory
